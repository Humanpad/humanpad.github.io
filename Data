Humanpad is a standard for uncrackable encryption, implemented by a human using only pen and paper techniques.

This provides extreme security.  By reducing or severely limiting the number of electronic side-channel attacks, plus an uncrackable one-time-pad encryption, human
messangers can be certain of the implementation is safe from electronic eavesdropping.  It is simple enough to be taught to children.  
It can also be used as a method of distributing symmetric keys for electronic messages.

There are two standards.  One using dice, one using coins.  Humanpad6 and humanpad8.  Humanpad8 is better for key-distribution and includes punctuation and capitalization. 
messages.  Humanpad6 is simpler to use.

Humanpad Keys:

To generate a humanpad key, gather your entropy devices (Coins or dice).

Humanpad6:

Go to a private room with no cameras.  

Roll dice.  Without moving the dice horizontally, move the dice vertically until they are in a line from left to right.
Write down the dice values left-to-right.  Fill up the paper this way.  Do it until you are bored or you have too much paper.   Put your name at the top of each page.
All the pages are your 'pad'
Make a copy of your pad for your friend.
Repeat steps 1-10 for each friend you wish to communicate with.  Each friend should have a seperate pad.  Label them.

Give your pad to your friend.  Make sure that nobody ever can get ahold of it.  Each of you should store your copies in a seperate secret place.

Encrypting a message:

Write your message down using only the characters A-Z0-9, no spaces.  Seperate sentences with newlines.

Convert each letter to two numbers using the table:

  1 2 3 4 5 6
1 A B C D E F
2 G H I J K L
3 M N O P Q R
4 S T U V W X
5 Y Z 0 1 2 3
6 4 5 6 7 8 9

Now, pick a page and offset from your pad that has not been used.  write down the page and offset <> in front of the sentence.  
Move from left to right and transform the numbers using this table:  (clock arithmetic, (a+b mod 6) + 1)

Encrypting:
          plaintext
         1 2 3 4 5 6
       1 2 3 4 5 6 1
       2 3 4 5 6 1 2
pad    3 4 5 6 1 2 3
       4 5 6 1 2 3 4
       5 6 1 2 3 4 5 
       6 1 2 3 4 5 6

Every time you use a number from your pad, cross it off/black it out.  When a page is empty, burn it.

Decrypting a message:

The message gives you the pageid and the offset.  Start there.  Above the message, write each of the pad values above each of the ciphertext values.
Cross off the pad values as you go.

For each pair (pad and cipher) use this table to write a new number down.

Decrypting:
          ciphertext
         1 2 3 4 5 6
       1 6 5 4 3 2 1
       2 1 6 5 4 3 2
pad    3 2 1 6 5 4 3
       4 3 2 1 6 5 4
       5 4 3 2 1 6 5 
       6 5 4 3 2 1 6
       
Then convert each pair of two values to letters:
Convert each letter to two numbers using the table:

  1 2 3 4 5 6
1 A B C D E F
2 G H I J K L
3 M N O P Q R
4 S T U V W X
5 Y Z 0 1 2 3
6 4 5 6 7 8 9
